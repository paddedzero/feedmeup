  # --- Fixes for the Build Error ---
  - vendor/bundle/   # These 'vendor' lines are the most important
  - vendor/cache/    # part of the fix. They stop Jekyll from
  - vendor/gems/     # looking inside the Ruby installation folder,
  - vendor/ruby/     # which was the source of the build failure.

  # --- Standard Jekyll Exclusions ---
  - Gemfile          # These are Ruby development files that
  - Gemfile.lock     # don't need to be in the final website.
