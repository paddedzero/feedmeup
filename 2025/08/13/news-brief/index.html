    <p><strong>Automated Reasoning checks is now available in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails</strong> — &lt;p&gt;AWS announces the general availability of Automated Reasoning checks, a safeguard within Amazon Bedrock Guardrails that uses formal verification techniques to validate the accuracy and policy compliance of outputs from generative AI models. Automated Reasoning checks deliver up to 99% accuracy at detecting correct responses from LLMs - giving you provable assurance in detecting AI hallucinations while also assisting with ambiguity detection in model responses.<br /> <br /> Automated Reasoning checks provides a fundamentally different approach from traditional testing methods. Unlike sampling outputs for quality, Automated Reasoning checks offers mathematically rigorous guarantees that AI responses adhere to defined business rules and domain knowledge. This is especially valuable for enterprises in regulated industries that require unambiguous validation of AI outputs before deployment.<br /> <br /> Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails is now generally available in the US (N. Virginia), US (Ohio), US (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), and Europe (Paris) Regions. Customers can access the service through the Amazon Bedrock console, as well as the Amazon Bedrock Python SDK.<br /> <br /> To learn more about Automated Reasoning checks and how you can integrate it into your generative AI workflows, please visit the Amazon Bedrock documentation. You can also reach out to your AWS account team or an AWS Solutions Architect to discuss your specific use case and requirements. CloudFormation support will be coming soon. Read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/minimize-ai-hallucinations-and-deliver-up-to-99-verification-accuracy-with-automated-reasoning-checks-now-available" target="_blank">news blog</a>, review the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-automated-reasoning-checks.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>, or visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/" target="_blank">Guardrails webpage</a> to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
