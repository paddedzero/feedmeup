Hereâ€™s a short but clear README draft you can drop into your repo to remind yourself how the whole setup works and what to edit.

## **README.md**

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project **automatically collects and publishes** curated news on AI, cybersecurity, cloud security, regulatory changes, and Asia-Pacific cyber policy.
It uses a **Python script** to pull news from selected sources, filter them using keywords, format them as Jekyll posts, and publish them to a **static site on GitHub Pages**.

---

### âš™ How It Works

1. **`fetch_news.py`** â€” Fetches headlines, applies keyword filters, and generates Markdown files in the Jekyll `_posts` folder.
2. **`config.yaml`** â€” Holds your **keyword filters** and **news source list**. Edit this file to change what content is pulled.
3. **GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/news.yml`)** â€” Runs the script on schedule, commits new posts, and pushes them to GitHub Pages.
4. **Jekyll site** â€” Renders the `_posts` Markdown files as blog posts at your GitHub Pages URL.

# feedmeup â€” automated news brief generator

This project pulls news from configured RSS/Atom feeds, filters items by keywords, and generates Jekyll-compatible Markdown posts which are published to GitHub Pages.

## How it works (high level)

- `fetch_news.py` â€” fetches feeds, filters by `config.yaml` keywords, groups similar items, and writes `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-news-brief.md` files.
- `config.yaml` â€” where you list `sources` (name, url, category) and `filters.keywords`.
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/news.yml`) â€” runs the script on schedule and pushes generated posts to the Pages branch.

## Where to update feeds and categories

Edit `config.yaml` in the repository root. Each source follows this format:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: Example Site
    url: https://example.com/feed.xml
    category: Security
```

When you add a new source, pick a `category` that groups similar sites (e.g., `LLM`, `Cloud`, `Security`, `Vulnerability`, `ThreatIntel`, `Regulation`).

Below is the current feed list (name â€” category â€” url). To change the feed list, open `config.yaml` and edit the `sources:` section.

## How to add/remove feeds (step-by-step)

1. Open `config.yaml` and locate the `sources:` list.
2. Add a new entry using the same `name/url/category` keys.
3. Save and push the change to your repo. The next scheduled run (or manual dispatch) will pick up the new feed.

Example addition:

```yaml
- name: New Research Blog
  url: https://newsite.example/feed.xml
  category: ThreatIntel
```

If you remove a source, delete its block from `config.yaml` and push; the site will stop pulling from that feed.

## Running locally (quick)

1. Create and activate a venv (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script:

```powershell
python fetch_news.py
```

Check `_posts/` for generated Markdown. If you want to test CI behavior, run `pytest` or push a test commit.

## Troubleshooting

- If no posts are generated: verify `config.yaml` has `sources` and `filters.keywords` are present; inspect CI logs for feed fetch errors.
- If posts do not appear on your Pages site: confirm the workflow committed to the branch configured in GitHub Pages (commonly `gh-pages`).
- If a feed breaks formatting: add the feed but expect some summaries to be HTML; `fetch_news.py` sanitizes summaries but you can tweak `format_entries_for_category` in the script.

## Contributing / Maintenance

- Keep `requirements.txt` updated and run `pip-audit` periodically.
- Move generated posts into the Pages branch (CI should handle this). Do not keep generated posts committed on your main branch â€” they are now in `.gitignore`.
